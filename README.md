## A website where individuals financially struggling with the coronavirus can find food 🥔. 

### 📍 About
I thought it would be nice if I could help people struggling from the corona-virus pandemic. Through these harsh times, it's hard for financially deprived individuals to find food. So I created a website to locatte foodbanks near them.
